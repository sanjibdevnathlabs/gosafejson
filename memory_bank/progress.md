## 🎯 VAN MODE COMPLETION STATUS

### ✅ All VAN Milestones Complete
1. ✅ Platform Detection 
2. ✅ Memory Bank Initialization
3. ✅ File Verification
4. ✅ Complexity Determination → **LEVEL 3**

### 🚨 Mode Transition Required
**Current Status**: VAN Mode Complete  
**Next Action**: **MUST transition to PLAN mode**  
**Reason**: Level 3 complexity requires structured planning methodology

#### 📋 Transferred to PLAN Mode

**5. Detailed Analysis** (If Level 1)
- 📋 File-by-File Review: Comprehensive source analysis
- 📋 Test Coverage Analysis: Quality assessment
- 📋 Performance Profiling: Optimization analysis
- 📋 Documentation Completion: Full context capture
