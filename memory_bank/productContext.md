# Product Context: gosafejson

## Product Purpose

**gosafejson** appears to be a Go library for safe JSON processing, likely providing:
- Enhanced JSON parsing and manipulation capabilities
- Type-safe operations on JSON data
- Performance-optimized JSON handling
- Extended functionality beyond standard Go JSON package

## Key Product Features (Initial Analysis)

### Core Functionality
- **Any Type System**: Flexible JSON value handling (`any_*.go` files)
- **Iterator Pattern**: Stream-based JSON processing (`iter_*.go` files)  
- **Reflection-based Processing**: Dynamic type handling (`reflect_*.go` files)
- **Stream Processing**: Efficient data stream handling (`stream_*.go` files)

### Extension Support
- **Custom Codecs**: Binary as string, time as int64, fuzzy decoding
- **Naming Strategies**: Flexible field naming conventions
- **Private Field Access**: Advanced reflection capabilities

### Performance Focus
- **Benchmarking Suite**: Comprehensive performance testing
- **Pool Management**: Object pooling for memory efficiency
- **Optimized Algorithms**: Specialized implementations for different data types

## Target Use Cases

Based on file structure analysis:
1. **High-performance JSON processing** in Go applications
2. **Type-safe JSON manipulation** with compile-time guarantees
3. **Stream processing** for large JSON datasets
4. **Flexible JSON schema handling** with custom codecs
5. **Enterprise-grade JSON validation** and transformation

## Competitive Landscape

This library likely competes with:
- Standard `encoding/json` package (performance/features)
- Third-party JSON libraries like `jsoniter` (may be based on or inspired by)
- Custom enterprise JSON solutions

## Quality Indicators

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Multiple test directories with extensive coverage
- **Benchmarking**: Performance-focused development
- **Fuzzing Support**: Security and reliability testing
- **Clear Structure**: Well-organized codebase with logical separation
