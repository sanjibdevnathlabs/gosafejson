**All Deliverables:** Successfully created and documented  
**Quality Level:** Professional-grade foundation framework established  
**Ready for:** Phase 2 Core Module Analysis

## Implementation Plan Summary

### Components Identified for Analysis
- **Core Modules**: 33 files (any_*, iter_*, reflect_*, stream_*)
- **Test Infrastructure**: 8 directories with comprehensive coverage
- **Configuration**: 4 core files (config.go, adapter.go, pool.go, jsoniter.go)
- **Extensions**: custom codecs and specialized functionality
