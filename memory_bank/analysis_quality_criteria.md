## 4. Analysis Process Quality

### Systematic Approach
- [ ] **Template Usage** - Every analysis must use the standardized template
- [ ] **Sequential Analysis** - Follow the template sections in order for consistency
- [ ] **Cross-Reference Verification** - Verify claims by cross-referencing with related files
- [ ] **Quality Self-Assessment** - Complete the quality self-assessment section

### Verification Process
- [ ] **Code Reading** - Actually read and understand the code being analyzed
- [ ] **Pattern Verification** - Verify identified patterns through code examination
- [ ] **Dependencies Validation** - Validate all documented dependencies
- [ ] **Integration Testing** - Verify integration claims through code tracing

### Review Standards
- [ ] **Internal Consistency** - Ensure analysis is internally consistent
- [ ] **Cross-File Consistency** - Ensure consistency with analyses of related files
- [ ] **Architecture Alignment** - Verify alignment with overall architectural framework
- [ ] **Quality Criteria Met** - Verify all quality criteria have been met

## 6. Quality Checkpoints

### File-Level Checkpoints
Before marking any file analysis as complete:
- [ ] **All 13 template sections completed** with substantive content
- [ ] **Code has been read and understood** for accuracy verification
- [ ] **Architecture patterns correctly identified** and documented
- [ ] **Dependencies verified** through actual import analysis
- [ ] **Quality self-assessment completed** honestly and accurately

### Module-Level Checkpoints
Before completing any module group (any_*, iter_*, etc.):
- [ ] **All files in module analyzed** using consistent approach
- [ ] **Module integration patterns documented** across all files
- [ ] **Cross-file dependencies within module mapped** accurately
- [ ] **Module's role in overall architecture clarified** and documented
- [ ] **Module quality assessment consistent** across all files

### Phase-Level Checkpoints
Before transitioning between implementation phases:
- [ ] **All planned deliverables completed** for the current phase
- [ ] **Quality metrics met** for all analyses in the phase
- [ ] **Architecture integration verified** for all analyzed components
- [ ] **Cross-phase consistency maintained** with previous analyses
- [ ] **Next phase readiness confirmed** through dependency verification

## 7. Common Quality Issues to Avoid

### Analysis Quality Anti-Patterns
- **Generic Descriptions** - Avoid generic, template-like descriptions
- **Unverified Claims** - Don't make claims without code verification
- **Inconsistent Terminology** - Maintain consistent technical language
- **Incomplete Sections** - Every template section must be meaningfully completed
- **Surface-Level Analysis** - Go beyond surface observations to understand implementation

### Documentation Quality Anti-Patterns
- **Placeholder Text** - No template placeholders should remain in final analysis
- **Copy-Paste Errors** - Each analysis must be unique and file-specific
- **Inconsistent Formatting** - Maintain consistent markdown structure
- **Missing Code Examples** - Include relevant code snippets for key points
- **Vague Assessments** - Provide specific, justified assessments

### Process Quality Anti-Patterns
- **Skipping Code Reading** - Every file must be actually read and understood
- **Pattern Misidentification** - Verify patterns through careful code analysis
- **Dependency Inaccuracy** - Verify all dependencies through actual import checking
- **Architecture Misalignment** - Ensure all files fit the established architecture
- **Quality Shortcuts** - Don't compromise on quality for speed

## 8. Quality Assurance Process

### Self-Assessment Requirements
For each file analysis, complete this self-assessment:
- [ ] **Code Understanding:** "I have read and understood the code in this file"
- [ ] **Pattern Accuracy:** "I have correctly identified the architecture patterns used"
- [ ] **Dependency Verification:** "I have verified all documented dependencies"
- [ ] **Quality Standards:** "This analysis meets all established quality criteria"
- [ ] **Actionability:** "This analysis provides actionable insights for developers"

### Peer Review Standards (If Applicable)
- [ ] **Technical Accuracy Review** - Verify technical claims through code examination
- [ ] **Consistency Review** - Check consistency with other analyses
- [ ] **Quality Standards Review** - Verify all quality criteria have been met
- [ ] **Actionability Review** - Confirm insights are actionable and valuable

### Quality Improvement Process
- [ ] **Identify Quality Gaps** - Regularly assess where quality can be improved
- [ ] **Update Standards** - Evolve quality criteria based on lessons learned
- [ ] **Apply Lessons Learned** - Apply insights from early analyses to later ones
- [ ] **Maintain High Standards** - Never compromise on quality for expediency
